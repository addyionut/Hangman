# Hangman
The clasic game where you have to guess the word.
A single-player game where the computer randomly chooses a word and the player must guess it. He can insert letters, one by one, or the whole word. If the word is correct, a winning message appears, otherwise, after 7 wrong inserted letters, the game is over.
//For test purpose only, you can see in the Console the current word to be guessed.
